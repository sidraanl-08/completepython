    "## 1. What is a compiler?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A compiler is a special program that translates the entire source code of a programming language into machine code (or an intermediate form) before the program is run\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: Human-readable source code (like C, C++, or Java).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output: Machine code or an executable file that the computer can run directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When errors are found: The compiler shows errors before execution (compile-time errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why we use it: It makes the program fast because the translation is done once, and the executable can run multiple times without translating again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of a compiler as a translator who converts an entire book from English to French before anyone reads it. You don’t need to translate each sentence while reading; it’s all ready to read at once."
