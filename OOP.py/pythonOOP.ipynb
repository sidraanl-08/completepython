    "\n",
    "- People used first procedural programming which caused redundancy in code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then devs used functional programming where functions were used to minimize redundancy and maximize readability\n",
    "\n",
    "- However a more better way of modern coding is OOP which uses objects and classes to maximize code readablity\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is not compulsory to use OOP in every python project, but we must know this concept as a good coder\n",
    "\n",
    "- In simple words, OOP is all about creating objects \n",
    "\n",
    "- An object in OOP is a group of interrelated variables and functions \n",
    "\n",
    "- These variables are properties of the objects while functions can be behavior of the objects\n",
