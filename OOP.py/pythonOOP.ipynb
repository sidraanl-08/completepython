    "- To map with real world scenarios, we use objects in code which is called object oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- People used first procedural programming which caused redundancy in code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then devs used functional programming where functions were used to minimize redundancy and maximize readability\n",
    "\n",
    "- However a more better way of modern coding is OOP which uses objects and classes to maximize code readablity\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is not compulsory to use OOP in every python project, but we must know this concept as a good coder"
